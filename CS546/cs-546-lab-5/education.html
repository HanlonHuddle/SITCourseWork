      <h2>Life in Stevens</h2>
      <p>I am still doing my Master's degree of Computer Science in Stevens, I like the school.</p>
      <p>The class I love most was "Introduction to How to Make Your Life Easier"</p>
      <p>I cannot forget how I first meet my true love, VSCode. It is light weighted, simple to use and really powerful</p>
      <p>It is surelly the best product ever made by HugeHard ^^</p>

      <h2>Life in Huang San Xiao</h2>
      <p>I graduate from that school long ago, my degree was 'playing with sands'</p>
      <p>The class I love most was 'There is nothing more interesting than playing with sands'</p>
      <p>It was truelly the most easy period of my life, when you are young there was nothing serious that you need to thing about.</p>
      <p>Just play, eat, seep and play again</p>
      <p>I will never forget one of my teacher that allow us to play in the yard during her class</p>
      <p>She said that children should play, working and studying hard are adult's work</p>
      <p>I totoally agree with her, children should have fun and play with sands</p>
